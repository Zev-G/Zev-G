<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Zev Godfrey</h1>

<p align="center">I'm a 17 year old developer from Victoria BC studying Computer Science at UofT. I've been programming primarily in Java since early 2020 but I also have projects in a variety of languages and frameworks. Lately I've been learning C#, .NET, and UWP (Universal Windows Platform) to build a powerful note taking application that I use everyday.</p>

## What I'm currently working on

- UWP: A handwritten notetaking application.
- JavaFX: my two latest JavaFX projects have been [JFXPlus](https://github.com/Zev-G/JFXPlus), a library which adds useful components and **devtools** to JavaFX, and [Drawing App](https://github.com/Zev-G/Drawing-App), a drawing application with an infinite canvas.
- Web: currently I'm developing [my website](https://www.zevg.ca) and remaking my [JavaFX chess game](https://github.com/Zev-G/Chess) on [a website](https://www.zevg.ca/chess).
