<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Zev Godfrey</h1>

<p align="center">I'm a 19 year old developer from Victoria BC studying Computer Science at UofT. I've been programming primarily in Java since early 2020 but I also have projects in a variety of languages and frameworks. Lately I've been learning C#, .NET, and UWP (Universal Windows Platform) to build a powerful note taking application that I use everyday.</p>

<h1 align="center">Zink Note</h1>

<p align="center">My main project at the moment is <a href="https://zink.zevg.ca">Zink Note</a> a handwritten note taking app I use every day to take my notes and do my homework. The app is available for download on the <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/Zink%20Note/9NRQ660Z1RC4?launch=true%20%20&mode=full">Microsoft Stroe</a>.</p>
